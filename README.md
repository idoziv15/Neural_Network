# Machine Learning Demonstration Project

This project is designed to demonstrate key techniques and methods in machine learning using Python. The project covers various steps such as data preparation, model training, and evaluation. It is structured as a practical demonstration rather than a tutorial, intended for showcasing specific skills in applying machine learning algorithms.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook includes methods for handling missing data, normalization, and splitting the dataset.
- **Model Training**: We use common machine learning algorithms to train models on the processed dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate the trained models.
- **Cross-Validation**: Cross-validation techniques are demonstrated to ensure robust model performance.
